# History of Internet
The Internet was developed by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf in the 1970s. They began the design of what we today know as the 'internet. ' It was the result of another research experiment which was called ARPANET, which stands for Advanced Research Projects Agency Network.

# In this field we have to going to learn HTML,CSS,Java script and react
 
 # HTML:
 First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks .

# css:
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces.

# JAVA SCRIPT:
JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.

# REACT:
React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which present data that changes over time. Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. React abstracts away the DOM from you, offering a simpler programming model and better performance
